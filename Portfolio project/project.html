              Portfolio A portfolio is a curated collection showcasing your
              skills, work, and achievements, often used to demonstrate
              expertise to potential clients, employers, or collaborators. A
              portfolio website is typically created using HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. HTML structures the content, CSS styles the design to
              make it visually appealing, and JavaScript adds interactivity,
              such as animations, sliders, or dynamic elements. A well-crafted
              portfolio website reflects professionalism and highlights your
              unique value and capabilities.

              Calculator A calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a
              simple yet effective project that showcases core web development
              skills. HTML provides the structure of the calculator, defining
              buttons for numbers and operations, and a display area for
              results. CSS styles the layout, ensuring the calculator is
              visually appealing and user-friendly. JavaScript adds
              functionality, enabling the calculator to perform mathematical
              operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
              division. This project demonstrates how these technologies work
              together to create an interactive and functional web application.

            <p>
              Landing Page A landing page created with HTML and CSS serves as a
              focused, visually appealing web page designed to capture user
              attention and encourage specific actions, such as signing up or
              learning more about a product. HTML structures the content,
              including headers, images, and call-to-action buttons, while CSS
              enhances the design with engaging layouts, colors, fonts, and
              responsive elements for a seamless user experience across devices.
              Together, they create a professional, impactful landing page that
              effectively communicates your message.
